# Star Wars mod (WIP)

Adds several Star Wars themed blocks to Minetest. It is still very much a work-in-progress, as there are several currently unused textures and many changes planned.
The code license is WTFPL, while the furnace code was taken directly from Minetest Game, and retains the game's licence. There is no license for the textures at the moment, as I need to contact the texture authors for permission to publicly release this mod.
