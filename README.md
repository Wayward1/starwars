# Star Wars (WIP)

Adds several Star Wars themed nodes to Minetest.  It is still very much a work-in-progress, as there are several currently unused textures, no complete crafting recipes, several temporarily-empty node definitions, and many changes planned.  However, it is still perfectly usable, provided you have the creative or give privileges.

The code license is WTFPL, while the furnace code was taken directly from Minetest Game, and retains the game's license.  There is no license for the textures at the moment, as I need to contact the texture authors for permission to use the textures in a public release of this mod.
